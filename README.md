# Project objectives 
Gathering all the projects I have developed under this project
Creating a library from the codes I have developed
Avoiding writing the same codes in different projects unnecessarily because the code I have tried to write may have been written in another project
Avoiding unnecessary code repetition in all projects
Organizing project backups
Creating maven projects to make project dependencies globally available and updateable
Performing version control operations
Making backups on the internet against hardware problems
Backup of data in case of accidental, sabotage or hardware deletion
